# E-Commerce-Recommendation-System

This project is a complete end-to-end E-commerce Personalized Recommendation System designed to simulate how modern online stores recommend products to users. It applies Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and a Hybrid Recommendation Engine to generate accurate, data-driven suggestions.

The system also includes a visually appealing analytics dashboard, product insights, user activity tracking, and a REST API for integration with other applications.
